# MyUCLouvain Dashboard Customizer Extension

This Firefox extension is designed to enhance the user experience on the new **MyUCLouvain** dashboard by performing two main functions:

1. **Remove the News Panel**: This extension hides the news panel that appears on the homepage, providing a cleaner and more streamlined layout.
2. **Add Loading Animation**: It adds a simple loading animation to indicate when widgets are loading on the website, improving the visual feedback for users.

This extension is self-hosted, and the `.xpi` file is available in the GitHub releases section.
